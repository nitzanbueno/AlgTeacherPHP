# AlgTeacher
Rubik's cube algorithm-teaching and memory-training website.

You click the "add alg" button, and then you input your alg.
Algs are displayed in the site, and the ones you need to train on the most are displayed at the top.
When you click on an alg, you are presented its picture and are asked if you remember the alg.
If you do, the program remembers that and asks you again after 1 day, then if you remember it then it asks after 2 days, 
and so on until you remembered it for a whole week. Then the program stops asking.
If you don't remember, the program displays it to you and shifts your memory level (number of days before asking again) down for that alg.
